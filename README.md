# Module: C++ Advanced

This repository hosts the contents for the C++ Advanced (CPlA) module at
HSR. Current run **Spring Semester 2019**.

## Goal

In the course of this module students learn usage and understanding of
advanced features of modern C++. The topics of this course will cover:

-   Advanced concepts and language features
-   Functional and generic programming at run- and compile-time
-   Usage of advanced libraries, for example Boost libraries
-   A view behind the curtains of the C++ language standardization
-   Outlook to upcomming C++ features (C++20, ...)

Code examples in the lecture and exercises target the current C++
standard, also known als C++17. A pre-version of the language standard
can be found
[here](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4659.pdf).
This working draft lacks only minor editorial fixes compared to the
official standard.

## Skripteserver

Contents and resources not intended for public access are stored on an
[internal "skripte"
server](https://skripte.hsr.ch/Informatik/Fachbereich/C++_Advanced/CplA/)
at HSR.

## Cevelop

We recommend to use the [Cevelop](https://www.cevelop.com) for our C++
courses. While it is possible to use other IDEs, only Cevelop is:

-   platform independent
-   free to use
-   provides suitable support for unit testing with
    [CUTE](https://www.cute-test.com)
-   has quality-of-life features like assisted inclusion of standard
    library headers
-   hints about common programming mistakes
-   and can visualize template instances
