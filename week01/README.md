# Exercises Week 1

Goals of this weeks exercises:

-   You will setup or update your development environment, in order to
    be able to solve the exercises of this course properly. This
    includes installing a recent IDE and a compiler capable of C++17.
-   Solve small tasks to refresh your C++ knowledge accross the board.
-   Prepare for the upcomming testat by refurbishing your template
    writing skills.

# Set Up Your Development Environment

If you don't already have a development environment with
[Cevelop](https://www.cevelop.com) and a recent compiler take care of
this first. [Here](https://wiki.ifs.hsr.ch/CPlusPlus/ExW1) is a guide
from CPl on how to do it.

## Update Your Compiler

-   Install a recent version of GCC (version 9.2) or Clang (version
    9.0.0).
-   For Windows MinGW with a current GCC can be downloaded
    [here](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html).

## Update Cevelop

-   Get the latest Cevelop version [here](https://www.cevelop.com)


# 1. Easy C++ Repetition Tasks

For the following tasks write test cases first!

1.  Create a function that takes an `int` as parameter and returns the
    next value (`increment`).

    ``` cpp
    int const value = 19;
    auto const next = increment(value);
    ASSERT_EQUAL(20, next);
    ```

2.  Add an overload of `increment` that modifies the parameter as
    side-effect. Do you encounter any problems when calling increment in
    the presence of both overloads? Stick with the side-effect version
    for the following exercises.

    ``` cpp
    int value = 19;
    increment(value);
    ASSERT_EQUAL(20, value);
    ```

3.  Signed integers overflow is undefined behavior in C++. Make your
    function safe. If such an overflow would happen throw an exception
    instead of incrementing the value (`std::overflow_error`).

    ``` cpp
    int maxValue = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    ASSERT_THROWS(increment(maxValue), std::overflow_error);
    ```

4.  Change your `increment` to accept parameters of arbitrary type and
    increments them - given they support the prefix increment operator
    and `std::numeric_limits` provides a corresponding maximum value.
    Start your test cases with `double`.

    ``` cpp
    double value = 1.5;
    increment(value);
    ASSERT_EQUAL(2.5, value);
    ```

5.  Overflow for `unsigned` types is well defined. Add an overload for this
    case that does not throw. Does it need to be a template
    specialization?

    ``` cpp
    auto maxValue = std::numeric_limits<unsigned long long>::max();
    increment(maxValue);
    ASSERT_EQUAL(0, maxValue);
    ```

6.  Several overloads are required to cover all cases of `unsigned` type
    (i.e.Â `unsigned`, `unsigned long`) because the template has an exact
    match for the overload resolution unless you provide an overload for
    the specific type. Example: If you provide the overload for
    `unsigned long long` and call increment with an `unsigned` variable
    as argument the template will be chosen instead of the
    `unsigned long long` overload. Therefore, try an alternative
    approach to tackle overflows. Create a predicate (as template)
    `allowOverflow` that returns `false` by default but can and should
    be specialized for `unsigned` types to be `true`. You can implement
    the predicate as variable, class or function template for that
    matter.

7.  With all the template specializations for the different `unsigned`
    types there is still much code, at least it avoids duplication in
    the logic. As usual, the standard library can help. Have a look at
    `std::numeric_limits::is_integer` and the `is_unsigned` type trait.
    Can you implement your predicate with those?

8.  Can you also pass an iterator to your `increment` function? You
    might experience different outcomes depending on your compiler. It
    might not be happy if you want to get `numeric_limits` for your
    iterator. Adapt your `increment` function to also have the
    capability to take a second parameter to have a user-provided limit.
    Your previous tests should still remain working. Therefore, add a
    default argument to that parameter. You probably used comparisons
    and a `-1` operation to your limit. Does this restrict the iterators
    you can use with `increment`?

    ``` cpp
    std::vector<int> v{1};
    auto it = std::end(v);
    ASSERT_THROWS(increment(it, std::end(v)), std::overflow_error);

    double d{9.5};
    ASSERT_THROWS(increment(d, 9.0), std::overflow_error);
    ```

# 2. Fraction Type

Implement your own `Fraction` type that can represent fraction numbers
more precisely than the `double` type.

-   Your type will need to store the `numerator` and `denominator` as
    the largest available integral type.
-   Your type should be explicitly convertible to `double`
-   Implement the basic arithmetic operations `+`, `-` (unary and
    binary), `*` and `/`. After every operation try to reduce
    `numerator` and `denominator`
-   Add increment and decrement operators for your `Fraction` type.
-   You shall use boost/operators to avoid writing unnecessary code
    yourself.
-   Provide input and output operators

<!-- -->

``` cpp
Fraction half{1, 2};
auto quarter = +half * -half / -Fraction{1};
quarter++;
--quarter;
std::cout << quarter << ' ' << static_cast<double>(half) << '\n'; //prints 1/4 0.5
```

## 3. `dynArray` Repetition (Optional)

At the end of the C++ module you had an assignment in the exercises to
create a `vector`-like container that features the capabilities to
access its elements with negative indices
(https://wiki.ifs.hsr.ch/CPlusPlus/ExW11). In the C++ Advanced module we
will have an in-depth look at the implementation of bounded buffer
container. We will expect that you are familiar and can easily implement
containers like the `dynArray` example. Revisit the implementation of
this task, implement it again or study the code carefully, in order to
be properly prepared for the upcomming testat assignments.
